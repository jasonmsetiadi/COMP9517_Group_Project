runs: 
    debug: several tries of training, fulltry3 is the current best one.
        weight: weights of trained model
        reports: graphs generated by yolo
        val: validation set
    predict: results of prediction on test_set
        images: bounded test_set iamges(to avoiding excessing size, I have to delete most of them)
        label: predicted test_set label

runs_3_epochs: early try of 3 epochs

predict_test_fulltry3: generate prediction on test_set

train_continue_yolo: training code

train_tune_weakclasses: code of tuning fulltry3, still on progress

yolov8n: initial yolo weights
